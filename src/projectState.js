      learning: 'I got a better understanding of fetching API data, using different libraries such as React maps, react tooltips, bootstrap, d3-scale etc. This project was difficult for me because I had to learn how to populate the map with the data points which is something I have not done before.',

I also learned how to implement conditionals. For example, the background colour of the pokemon will change depending on what type the pokemon is. If it is a fire type pokemon, the background colour will change to red. If it is a water type pokemon, the background colour will change to blue. I also got a better understanding of Styled components. Lastly, I learned how to import FontAwesome Icons into my application to give it a visual boost to it.',

This application fetches the stats for each player and products a graph of the statistics for the season.',

I learned how to create a dropdown menu and depending on which option was selected, it would change the graph being displayed, such as points, assists or blocks.

For example, admins would have access to the admin dashboard while a normal user would not have access to the admin dashboard.',
      learning: 'This project has led me to learn a lot about the full stack development processes. I learned about creating the client in ReactJS while the server side was creating in NodeJS. I learned about storing data in MongoDB, while also retrieving the data from it to display, as well as updating and deleting it so it could be a fully functioning CRUD application. I also learned how to use ExpressJS to help compliment and assist the creation of the server side in NodeJS. In the end, I learned how to combine the client and server side together and how ReactJS can send POST data to the server. This was a very complicated project to complete.',
